The given function establishes the hierarchy for the directoryâ€™s users and groups, while the is_user_in_group() function recursively identifies if a given ID is in the directory. The time complexity is linear in this case, where N is equal to the total number of groups and users given. The space complexity is O(D), depending on the number of nested groups (child, sub_child, etc.).
